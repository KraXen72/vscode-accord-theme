## about theme
This theme aims to be familiar, space efficient & robust.
- An assortment of grays for the backgrounds: dark-gray for side panels and a pleasing gray for main background.
- The syntax highlighting colors are from [United Ubuntu](https://github.com/rdnlsmith/vscode-linux-themes), a theme i've been using for ages & really like. 
- It has thin gray borders separating the screens & sharp corners, giving the theme a robust and stable feel

I recommend you use the theme with the **Material Product Icons** extension - [repo](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-material-product-icons), [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-product-icons)

It is based on the VSCode Dark, Dark+, Dark V2 Experimental and [United Ubuntu](https://github.com/rdnlsmith/vscode-linux-themes) themes. I added my fair bit of tweaks as well, mostly the apple green accent color.
